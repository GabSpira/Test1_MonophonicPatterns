# First Experiment - Monophonic Rhythmic Pattern Measurement and Perception Investigation

A Study on the Effect of Dynamic Accents on the Perception and Measurement of Rhythm Complexity 

Monophonic Patterns Experiment


This folder contains the data and the code used to investigate the perception and the possible measurement of complexity of monophonic rhythmic patterns.
Here's a break down explanation of the content of this folder: 


- /Stimuli:         here you can find the patterns included in the test in midi format, including 4 different velocity variations of each pattern of the original constant velocity dataset of Fitch & Rosenfeld

- /public:          this folder contains all the files that were necessary for the subjective listening test website definition, including the audio stimuli (/public/configs/resources/audio)

- /output:          here the test results are stored in a json format (three different subtest versions were published, and that's why the results are splitted in three files)

- /DataAnalysis:    in this folder there are all the elements that were necessary to conduct the analysis, from the complexity metrics class definition to the codes used to obtain significant graphic representations of the results.
